I have aggregated Crime data for each year across all divisions.
It seems that crime is going down every year, from 2008 to 2016.
Some specific crimes have an increase of 700% over period of 2008-2016.
I might need to single out "Crimes" that have increased during 2008-2016.
The reason for that is "Economy is down" during same period 2008-2009.
Emphasizing on "Crimes" that increase during economic downturn.
