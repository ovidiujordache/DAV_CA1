HYPOTHESIS: When ECONOMY IS DOWN [files:(live register, poverty rates)]  CRIME  IS  UP [files:(crimes_in_ireland)].
Also when ECONOMY IS DOWN, CULTURE IS UP [files:(third_level_entrance,expenditure_on_culture)].
When ECONOMY IS BOOMING CULTURE AND ART IS DOWN. As a vivid example, during the height of the Celtic Tiger in 2002, 
a controversial and widely debated monument, "The Spire of Dublin," was constructed. 
Conversely, at the decline of the Celtic Tiger around 2008-2009, the Samuel Beckett Bridge was built,
 showcasing another masterpiece from Santiago Calatrava.

Economy, Crime, Unemployment, Poverty, College Admissions, Culture and Art


Hypothesis in laymen terms:
 When poverty strikes, individuals face two options: the quick route of 
 turning to crime to make ends meet, or the slower, more sustainable route through culture and education.
 Both choices reflect personal decisions within society, rather than being driven primarly by a 
 collective moral force. Clearly  "personal decisions" involve additional context,influenced 
 by various factors(upbringing, educational background), which are beyond the scope of this report.

 There is a very poor correlation between Crime and Live Register.(Unemployed) -0.06.
 Have to look for more data or different data.
